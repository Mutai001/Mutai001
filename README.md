ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my skills in web development and building personal projects to expand my portfolio.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced concepts in full-stack web development, including front-end frameworks like React and back-end technologies like Node.js and Express.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and innovative web development initiatives where I can contribute my skills and learn from others in the community.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development, programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap and React.

âš¡ Fun fact: I speak many languages, but the ones I never joke with are the ones written in code! Nothing beats the thrill of debugging and crafting elegant solutions. When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring the world of photography, capturing moments in nature.
